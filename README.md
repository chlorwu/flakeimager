Welcome to the new and enhanced FlakeImager!

By Chloe Wu, 2025 SIP intern @ PHY-01 in Yan Lab under Carlos Gonzalez's mentorship.

NEW FEATURES (upgraded from the old FlakeImager):

- Actually know what tool you're using with the tool indicator at the top of the screen
- See where your line is going to be drawn with live line previews in measurement and color comparison tools
- Clear all button 
- Create a scale bar with the scale bar tool with adjustable magnification and length (screenshot and paste image into your work)
    
Change all occurences of the file path '/Users/chloewu/Downloads/' to your own file path to use on your computer.

Thank you to Bruce Li at the Velasco Lab for making the original FlakeImager, which this is based on. 
Thank you to Raymond Feng, an excellent fellow intern, for helping me debug some important stuff.

You can email chloe.yixuan.wu@gmail.com or Discord message @chlorine_4921 with any questions, suggestions or requests, and I'll get back to you within 24 hrs.
